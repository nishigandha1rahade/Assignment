Assignment

TOPIC:Python basic variable

Q1] Declare two variables ,’X’ and ‘Y’,and assign them integer values. Swap the value of these variables without using any temporary variable.
Ans:
X=20
y=50
x,y=y,x

Before swapping:
Value of x =20 and y=50
After swapping
Value of x=50 and y=20


Q2] Creates a program that calculates  the area of a rectangle. Take the length and width as input from the user and store them in variables. Calculate and display the area.

Ans:
Area of rectangle formulae is length*width
Program is 

length=45
width=50
area=length*width

Then i will print area then system give me value of the area is 2250

Q3]Write a python program that converts temperature from celsius to Fahrenheit. Take the temperature in celsius as input ,store it in a variable,convert it to Fahrenheit, and display the result

Ans:
The formula of Fahrenheit is Fahrenheit = celsius *1.8+32
 The program is 
celsius=43.8
fahrenheit=(celsius *1.8+32)

 Then i will print fahrenheit then system give me 110.84
Because fahrenheit=(43.8*1.8=32)=110.84


TOPIC:String based question 

Q1]write a python program that takes a String as input and print the length of the String.

Ans:
s=”aditi”
len(s)

Then system give me the length of the string s
The length of the string is in 5

Q2] Create a program that takes a sentence from the user and counts the number of vowels in the string

Ans:
def count_vowels(sentence):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    vowel_count = 0
    
    for char in sentence:
        if char in vowels:
            vowel_count+= 1
            
            return vowel_count
        
        #Get input from the user
        user_input =("Nishigandha Rahade")
        
        #call the function to count vowels
        num_vowels = count_vowels(user_input)
        
        #Display the result 
        print(f"Number of vowels in the sentence: {num_vowels}")

Enter a sentence :Nishigandha Rahade
Number of vowels in the sentence :7

Q3]Given a String ,reverse the order of characters using string slicing and print the reverse string .
Ans:
 The program is 

s=”my name is nishigandha”
S[::-1]
S

The original string is :” my name is nishigandha”
The reversed sliced string is : 'ahdnagihsin si eman ym'

Q4]write a program that takes as a string as input and checks if it is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards)
Ans:
s1=”abba”
rev_str = reversed(s1)
if list(s1) == list(rev_str):
   print("The string is a palindrome.")
else:
   print("The string is not a palindrome.")

Output :string is palindrom

Note :In this program,we have taken a string stored in s1

We reverse the string using the built-in function reversed().since this function returns a reversed object,we use the lisr() function to convert them into a list before comparing.


Q5]create a program that takes a string as input and removes all the spaces from it. Print the modified string without spaces

Ans:
The program is 
s2="this is my first assignment"
s2.replace(" ","")

Note:
Use the replace() method to replace spaces with an empty string:

The output is:'thisismyfirstassignment'
