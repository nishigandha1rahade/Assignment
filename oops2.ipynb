    "Ans:A method from a parent class can be called in Python using the super() function. It’s typical practice in object-oriented programming to call the methods of the superclass and enable method overriding and inheritance. Even if the current class has replaced those methods with its own implementation, calling super() allows you to access and use the parent class’s methods. By doing this, you may enhance and modify the parent class’s behavior while still gaining from it.\n",

It is a relationship exist when at least one of the parent classes can be accessed through multiple path from the bottommost class. The bottommost class inherits the members of the base class via different path so that it creates ambiguity or create duplicate members. The method resolution order(MRO) tells python how to search for inherited methods. This comes in case of multiple or hybrid inheritance when using super() because the MRO tells you exactly ehere the Python will look for method you are calling with super() and in what order. Every class has an .mro attribute that allows us to inspect the order.\n"

    "Ans:Polymorphism is most commonly associated with inheritance. In Python, child classes, like other programming languages, inherit methods and attributes from the parent class. Method Overriding is the process of redefining certain methods and attributes to fit the child class. This is especially handy when the method inherited from the parent class does not exactly fit the child class. In such circumstances, the method is re-implemented in the child class. Method Overriding refers to the technique of re-implementing a method in a child class.\n"

Or, you might use a function pointer as a callback function, which is called when a certain event happens.Function pointers should be used when you need to pass a function as an argument, or when you need to store a function for use later.

    "An abstract class can be considered a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class. A class that contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class. An abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation. While we are designing large functional units we use an abstract class. When we want to provide a common interface for different implementations of a component, we use an abstract class. \n",

Abstraction is the process of taking something complex and breaking it down into simpler, more manageable parts, while modularity is the practice of creating self-contained, reusable units of code. By using abstraction and modularity, developers can create code that is easier to understand, maintain, and modify, which can ultimately lead to a more efficient and effective development process. Additionally, abstraction and modularity can help improve the scalability and reliability of a codebase by making it easier to add new features or fix bugs without affecting the rest of the code.\n"

Their operating model is also very similar and based upon the relationship of parent and child classes. In fact, Polymorphism needs the great support of Abstraction to power itself, without Abstraction you cannot leverage the power of Polymorphism. Let's understand this by what Abstraction and Polymorphism provide to an object-oriented program. Abstraction is a concept to simplify the structure of your code. Abstraction allows you to view things in more general terms rather than looking at them as they are at the moment, which gives your code flexibility to deal with the changes coming in the future\n"
